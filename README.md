# Traffic Simulation

## About
A university project built in [Green Foot](https://www.greenfoot.org/door) using Java. Here I worked in a Agile team to simulate T-Junction and X-Junction traffic scenarios. I worked on many areas of the project including project plan, design, implementation and testing. Due to copyright restrictions I am only permitted to share the compiled programes.
